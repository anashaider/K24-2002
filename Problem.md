** Algorithm **

```
Q. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number
(i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as
well

```
 Ask the user to enter Nth value (the divisor).
 Ask the user to enter n value (the number to be divided).
 Check if the n % Nth == 0, then
 Print Nth is a divisor of n.
 Else, Print Nth is not a divisor of n.
 Check if the n % 2== 0, then
 Print Nth is an even number.
 Else, Print Nth is a odd number.
