Q. Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)
```

**Algorithm:**
```
Q.  Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
Q. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /,)
```
